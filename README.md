# Vue CLI 3.0 plugin with Tailwind and Purge CSS (Under Construction)

- Plugin works as expected via Vue CLI. Few notes, todo below.
- Readme coming soon!

### ToDo

- Multiple invokes add extra import lines in main(.js | .ts)
- Existing postscss config is not kept. Anything then autoprefixer will be removed.
